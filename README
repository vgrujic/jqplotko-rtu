TL;DR; App will update jqlot chart and grid while changing data in real time

Here is an example of web app whose data changes in real time (Model) and where those changes are reflected to diferent representations (Views). This is casual problem in real time web applications. i.e. In expenses allocation app, new expense should propagate to grid data representation and chart/plot data representation. Javascript libraries used for this problem: Knockout.js, jQuery/jqPlot. And twitter bootstrap 2 for nicer look.
